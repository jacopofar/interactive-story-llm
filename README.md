# Interactive story writing demo

This is a small demo of a tool to write fiction in tandem with an LLM.

In essence, a local LLM (`nchapman/mn-12b-inferor-v0.0`) is invoked to continue
a story based on previous messages, both from the user and generated by the
model itself.

There's no edit/delete functionality.

# How to run

You need Ollama already running on the default port, `uv` for python and `node`
for the frontend.

Go to the `auto-rp` subfolder, run `npm install` and `npm run dev` to start the
frontend.

In the project root, use `uv install` and `fastapi run`.
